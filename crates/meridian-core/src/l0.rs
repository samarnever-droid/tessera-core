//! L0 SPRINT (spec Phase 4): a thread-private, direct-mapped hot cache in
//! front of the engine — the ~ns read tier.
//!
//! Validation is the §3.4 counter scheme: every shard carries a mutation
//! counter that writers bump BEFORE any change becomes visible, so a cached
//! (key, generation, value) triple is valid exactly while no write has
//! touched the shard since it was filled. Coarse — any shard write
//! invalidates that shard's whole L0 population — but read-heavy hot keys
//! with rare writes are precisely the workload it exists for; the invalida-
//! tion Bloom from the spec is the deferred refinement.
//!
//! Values are owned copies, not `ValueRef`s: holding many long-lived pins
//! would stall the epoch collector (a thread's announced epoch is that of
//! its oldest pin), so the hot tier trades one copy per fill for GC liveness.
//! Slots are tagged with the engine's unique id, so two engines sharing a
//! thread never cross-contaminate.
